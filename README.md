Multiuser Time Log
------------------------------------

This plugin allows an authorized user to log time for multiple users by adding a multiple choice select field at the bottom of the log time form (only when creating, not when editing). The logged time will be created for those users selected. This is accessible only if the user has the 'manage_time_entries' permission.
